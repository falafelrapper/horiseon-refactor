# Horiseon Refactor/Challenge 1

## Welcome to the first Challenge of the UCLA Bootcamp!

Here we are refactoring a site who's starter code has been already provided with us. In this challenge we had a User Story and Acceptance Criteria that we needed to follow:

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## The Completed Challenge

After completing the challenge, we should have the same looking site, as viewed below. However, now we have made this website follow accessibility standards and now our site is more optimized to show up in search engines such as Google and Bing.

With that completed, we also have a completed code that also features notes in our CSS and semantic elements to make our code much more organized for others to view. See below:
